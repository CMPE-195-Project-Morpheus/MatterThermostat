# MatterThermostat

This code base is based upon the Espressif Arduino IDE Matter example code for a simulated thermostat (https://github.com/SiliconLabs/arduino/blob/main/libraries/Matter/examples/matter_thermostat/matter_thermostat.ino). This code base was modified to display and perform temperature arithmetic using Fahrenheit instead of Celsius. 

TODO:
Change input of temperature data from serial monitor to a DHT11 temperature and humidity monitor.
